\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusion}
This thesis proposed a unified framework which describes multiple main problems in (multi-)domain adaptation. Furthermore, we presented several novel methods for supervised (multi-)domain adaptation problem and non-domain-deterministic testing. We have showed the limitation of model-centric approaches in 
supervised (multi-)domain adaptation problem according to our novel multi-domain evaluation method. Unfortunately, by the limit of time, we have not explored the non-domain-deterministic training setting.

Among the four main problems of (multi-)domain adaptation \ref{chap:mdmt_review}, supervised (multi-)domain adaptation is the most studied. However, we showed that most of the previous methods are brittle to fuzzy domain separations and the continuous learning.
